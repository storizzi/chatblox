# Release 0.0.1

## General Information

* Version: 0.0.1
* Release Date: 26 Mar 2024
* Build ID: 1
* Summary: First MVP Release with Python + Node.js versions and sample scripts

## Description

This is the first release which is very very early. It is an MVP which does at least function, and seems to happily run different types of commands.

Note that the 'commands' directory contains the same commands in both the node + python version to demonstrate both versions can run the same scripts.

Minimal documentation. License information. Unfortunately I forgot to change it from private to public repo!
