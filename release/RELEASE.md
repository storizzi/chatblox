## 0.0.x releases

This is so bare-bones I'm making it 0.0.x! I'll make it 0.1.x once we have the first proper extensible plugin architecture and some solid functionality available. Consider this very experimental and liable to break stuff from older versionsbetween releases

* [0.0.3](./history/0.0/release-0.0.3.md) - Introduce plugins, hooks, debug mechanism, much improved README, remove python version, extend autoinstall, enable / disable plugins and commands, flexible locations for config, commands, plugins and settings. 
* [0.0.2](./history/0.0/release-0.0.2.md) - Update node.js package versions and python instructions, and add a new logo on LHS of text box and background
* [0.0.1](./history/0.0/release-0.0.1.md) - First MVP Release with Python + Node.js versions and sample scripts
